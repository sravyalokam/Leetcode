// PROBLEM OF THE DAY: Reverse Bits

// PROBLEM LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-02-16

// SOLUTION EXPLANATION:
// 1. The problem states that we are given a 32-bit integer n and we need to reverse its bits.
// 2. I initialized a variable result = 0 to store the reversed bits.
// 3. I iterated exactly 32 times (since it is a 32-bit integer).
// 4. In each iteration:
    // I extracted the least significant bit (LSB) using: n & 1
    // I shifted result one position to the left: result << 1
    // This creates space for the new bit.
    // Then I added the extracted bit to result using the OR (|) operation.
// 5. After that, I shifted n one position to the right using: n >> 1
// 6. After completing iterations, result contains the reversed 32-bit integer, which I return.

// SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

// TIME COMPLEXITY: O(32)
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
